# Joint A-SNN

Joint A-SNN: Joint Training of Artificial and Spiking Neural Networks via Self-Distillation and Weight Factorization

For Training, please use command:

python main.py 
--time (timestep) --epochs (total training epochs)  --batch_size (batchsize)

We have implemented the joint framework in the resnet.py file.
Other files provides the auxiliary functions and modules.

Our initial code is in internalframe with our owe Python packages.
